			"prompt": "HendrixJimmy has a narrow oval face with high cheekbones and a tapered jawline. His skin is warm medium-brown with slight reddish undertones. Wide-set almond-shaped brown eyes with long lashes, partially obscured by lids that sit at Â¾ mast, giving a relaxed intensity. Full lips slightly parted, revealing a small gap between the front teeth. A thin mustache follows the curve of his upper lip, connecting to sideburns that frame a clean-shaven jaw. His hair forms a voluminous afro (6-inch radius) with tight S-shaped curls, parted slightly off-center. A red cotton bandana tied around the crown of his head, with the knot positioned at the left temple. Wears a black velvet blazer with notched lapels over a cream silk shirt unbuttoned to mid-chest, revealing a silver medallion on a leather cord. Skinny black denim jeans with a 28-inch inseam, bunched over brown leather Chelsea boots. Hands are slender with long fingers, calloused at the fingertips, permanently arched in a B minor chord formation. Posture features a forward-leaning stance with right shoulder slightly raised during solos."
