			"prompt": "Performer-Lennon-John has a face that combines both strength and a laid-back charisma. His high cheekbones are prominent, giving him a slightly angular and sculpted appearance. His nose is long, slightly hooked, and well-defined, creating an almost aristocratic profile. His eyes are a striking, intense blue, framed by thick, expressive eyebrows that are dark and bold. These eyebrows curve slightly upward at the outer edges, adding a sense of intensity to his gaze. He wears a pair of signature round glasses with thin, black metal frames that have pink-tinted lenses, slightly distorting the sharpness of his eyes. His lips are full but relaxed, with a subtle, often contemplative smile. His face has a light layer of stubble, adding a rugged touch to his otherwise clean-cut features. His hair is thick and wavy, parted down the middle and cascading to his shoulders in textured, slightly messy layers, creating a wild yet controlled appearance. His hairline is a bit uneven, with slight recession at the temples."

			"prompt": "Hippie-Lennon-John has a soft and dreamy face, with well-defined high cheekbones that give him a youthful yet slightly ethereal look. His nose is long, straight, and slightly slender, giving him an elegant profile. His bright blue eyes are intense but peaceful, framed by thick, slightly unruly eyebrows that match his wavy, shoulder-length hair. His glasses are iconic round frames, with bright pink lenses that lend a quirky, whimsical touch to his face. His lips are fuller, often forming a relaxed, serene smile, as if he’s always at peace with the world around him. He has a light beard or stubble, adding a bit of texture to his soft features. His hair is long, thick, and very wavy, with loose, natural curls falling around his face and shoulders, giving him a carefree, bohemian vibe. The hair is parted messily on the side, often pushed back in some places. He has a calm, relaxed posture, often seen with his head tilted slightly, as if he’s lost in thought or spreading peace and love to those around him. His expression is gentle, approachable, and idealistic, as if always envisioning a better, more harmonious world."
